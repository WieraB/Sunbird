Allow windows 10 to be accessed from other PCs
Open Powershell with admin access
1. Make sure that OpenSSH is available
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH*'

This should tell which one is installed.
OpenSSH.Client is to access connections
OpenSSH.Server to create servers

2. Install missing stuffs
# Install the OpenSSH Client
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0

# Install the OpenSSH Server
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0

3. Go to services and find two servers starting with OPENssh
Start the services and set them to manual as we are not always using ssh

Now, our Windows 10 can accept and host ssh connections

4. On Linux PC, check if ssh deamon (service) is running
sudo systemctl status sshd
If not install 
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

5. Enable SSH server on system boot
sudo systemctl enable ssh

Now, from either windows or Ubuntu we can ssh using
ssh "Username"@localIP
  
Now configure Jupyter lab

1. Generate config file
jupyter lab --generate-config

2. Set password for security Ive set it as hell
jupyter lab password

3. start Jupyter lab from anaconda prompt on server computer
# ip 0.0.0.0   listen on all IPs
# --no-browser for not opening jupyter lab on the server itself
jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --port=8888

Find you local IP version 4
in Windows its ipconfig in cmd and find the ip for current hardware i.e. wifi or ethernet
in Linux its ip addr in terminal and find ip for current hardware

4. On the client computer
Open Google Chrome
type the URL as <your local ip address>:<port for jupyterlab>

If we want to use the public IP we need to do additional things which I don't know right now.
